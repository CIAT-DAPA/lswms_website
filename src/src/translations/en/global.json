The project aims at providing a near real-time surface water and pasture information that are gender and socially inclusive in pastoral areas of Ethiopia. The project developed a fully working interactive and dynamic web-based digital platform (ET - Monitoring) and installed at EIAR using Human-Centered Design (HCD). ET - Monitoring  provide surface water and pasture information for pastoralists, agro-pastoralists, decision makers, humanitarian assistance providers and other stakeholders who lack access to the information in pastoral areas of Ethiopia in three languages (English, Amharic and Afan Oromo).",

Their fundamental purpose is to keep users updated on any changes or developments in the water status. By providing detailed information about each water point, advisories enable users to make informed decisions in real-time. From precautionary alerts to indications of seasonal scarcity, these messages offer a clear view of the water landscape, empowering users to adapt and respond appropriately.",

By receiving these notices directly on their devices, users can stay informed about any changes in water status, regardless of their location or access to other sources of information. This rapid and direct communication promotes greater awareness of local water resources and encourages more active participation in their conservation and responsible use.",

By fully understanding the situation of each water point and the implications of its status, users can implement proactive measures to better manage their consumption and conserve this vital resource. In summary, advisories represent an essential tool for promoting sustainability and efficiency in water management, ensuring safe and equitable access for future generations.",
